## **Streamlit ML Classification**

**[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)** is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time

Here is my **[Web App.V1.0]([url](https://andrew2077-streamlit-ml-mlwebapp-mmhe32.streamlitapp.com)){:target="_blank"}**,

give it a visit and explore how Machine learning classification algorithms works

## **The Idea of the App**

Demonstrate the effectiveness of a machine learning model to classify data, while visualizing the results.

---

## **Features**

- Select a model from a dropdown menu provided from a list of models that were trained using the [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) library.
- Select a dataset from a dropdown menu provided from a list of datasets that were imported using sklearn.
- plot the the classified data using a scatter plot on a 2D plane, using the PCA algorithm. to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
